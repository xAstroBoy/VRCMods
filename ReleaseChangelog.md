Read the [Malicious Mods and you](https://github.com/xAstroBoy/VRCMods-Unchained/blob/master/Malicious-Mods.md) doc!

Changes:
 * Advanced Safety: updated BundleVerifier to catch more types of corrupted bundles
 * FavCat: fixed some worlds not appearing in favorites. Re-fetch favorites via "More FavCat..." menu and restart the game to fix already-missing ones.
 * IKTweaks: if IKT spine solver is disabled, settings relevant only to it will be hidden
 * IKTweaks: added an option to change knee angles when not using knee trackers (enabled by default)
 * ScaleGoesBrr: fixed shoulders moving wrong if shoulder trackers are in use
